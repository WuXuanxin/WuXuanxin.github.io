In this blog, I‚Äôll share my experience of creating a LINE chatbot powered by OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. The goal is to attach a LINE official account with an auto-reply chatbot function that responds based on the user‚Äôs current message and conversation history. The best part? No coding is required!

      <h2>Example: Chatbot Conversation</h2>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>Here is an example of a conversation between a user and a chatbot, showcasing the chatbot's context-aware responses:</p>
      {% include figure.liquid 
         loading="eager" 
         path="assets/img/zero_code_chatbot/example.jpg"
         class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"

         width="60%"
         height="40%"
      %}
      <p>To achieve this, you will need the following tools:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API</strong></li>
        <li><strong>LINE Official Account</strong></li>
        <li><strong>MAKE Account</strong>: To automate the workflow between LINE and OpenAI.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you haven't set them up yet, refer to the instructions on the right. Skip this section if you already have them.</p>

## Step 3: Build the Chatbot Workflow in MAKE

I created a chatbot for Japanese language learning. Here‚Äôs how it works:

### Overview
- The chatbot receives a user‚Äôs message, retrieves conversation history from the database, aggregates the data, sends it to OpenAI, and replies to the user.

### Behind the Scenes: MAKE Scenarios

1. **LINE ‚Üí Watch Events**: Add your webhook to listen for user messages.
2. **Data Store Search Records**:
   - Search the user‚Äôs message history within the last 2 minutes (adjust the `{-2}` value as needed).
3. **Text Aggregator**:
   - Aggregate the current query and historical queries from the Data Store.
4. **Data Store**:
   - Search the chatbot‚Äôs reply history to the user within the last 2 minutes.
5. **Tools**:
   - Aggregate the conversation history and current query to prepare the input for OpenAI.
6. **OpenAI**:
   - Configure the model (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4).
   - Set up messages:
     - **Message 1**: Your custom prompt (edit in Text Content).
     - **Message 2**: User query history (from the first Data Store).
     - **Message 3**: Chatbot reply history (from the second Data Store).
     - **Message 4**: Current user query.
   - Adjust hyperparameters like `temperature` and `top_p` as needed.
7. **Ignore Module**:
   - Acts as an error handler to keep the scenario running even if errors occur. Learn more [here](https://www.make.com/en/help/errors/error-handlers/ignore-error-handler).
8. **LINE ‚Üí Send a Reply Message**:
   - Send the chatbot‚Äôs reply (from OpenAI) back to the user.
9. **Ignore Module**:
   - Again, acts as an error handler to keep the scenario running even if errors occur. 
10. **Data Store**:
   - Append the user‚Äôs query to the Data Store.
11. **Data Store**:
    - Append the chatbot‚Äôs reply to the Data Store.

## Final Thoughts
Building a LINE chatbot with OpenAI and Make is a powerful way to create intelligent, automated interactions. Whether you‚Äôre building a language-learning bot or a customer support assistant, this no-code approach makes it accessible to everyone.

Feel free to tweak the workflow to suit your needs, and let me know if you have any questions!
