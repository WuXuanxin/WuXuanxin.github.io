I am a Ph.D. student working on Natural Language Processing (NLP). I am affiliated with [Onizuka Lab](http://www-bigdata.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/) in Osaka University and [Arase Lab](https://arase-cl-lab.c.titech.ac.jp/) in Institute of Science Tokyo. I received the M.A. Degree in theorectical linguistics from Osaka University in 2023. Since starting my Ph.D., I have been working in computational linguistics.

My research mainly focuses on text simplification, evaluation of large language models, and NLP tools for educational purpose. With support from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), I also investigate the society impact of NLP techonology.

Outside of academy, I worked as a DJ at [FM COCOLO](https://cocolo.jp/), a multilingual radio station in Japan, from 2020 to 2024.
